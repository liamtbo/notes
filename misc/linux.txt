problem
    folder with subfolders full of images that I want to put all into one folder
solution
    find <parent path> -mindepth 2 -type f -exec mv -t <cuml folder path> {} +
        find <parent path>
            starting dir that find will search for files
        -mindepth 2
            ensures find only considers files that are insdie subdirs
        -type f
            tells find to only look for files
        -exec mv -t <cuml folder path> {} +
            -exec mv
                executes mv
            -t <cuml folder path>
                target dir specification
            {}
                placeholder for each file found by find
            +
                tells find to pass multiple files paths at once to mv command (faster then one at a time)

problem
    how many file are in a folder
solution
    find <folder path> -type f | wc -l
        find <folder path>
            searches in folder specified
        -type f
            only files, not dirs
        | wc -l
            pipes output (list of files) to wc -l, which counts the number of lines, each representing a file
