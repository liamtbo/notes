linear regression
    computes linear relationship between the dependent variable (y) and one or more independent features (x) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
simple linear regression
    one independent features
    y=β0​+β1​X
multiple linear regression  
    mult independent features
    y=β0​+β_1 * ​X_1 + β_2 ​* X_2 +………βn​Xn
        Y is the dependent variable
        X1, X2, …, Xn are the independent variables
        β0 is the intercept
        β1, β2, …, βn are the slopes
