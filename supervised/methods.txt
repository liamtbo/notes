supervised learning
    use decision trees if
        need simple, interpretable model
        smaller dataset
        quick and easy baseline model
        problem doesn't require capturing complex patterns
    use neural networks if
        problem is complex and requires capturing intricate relationships
        large, high dim datasets
        sufficient computational resources
        interpretability is less concerning
