1. Initializing K-means for Different Values of k:

    For each chosen value of kk, you would initialize kk centroids randomly within the dataset.

2. Running the K-means Algorithm:

    For each initialization (i.e., each set of kk random centroids):
        Assignment Step: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming kk clusters.
        Update Step: Recalculate the centroids by taking the mean of all the data points in each cluster.
        Repeat: Continue the assignment and update steps until the centroids stabilize (i.e., they no longer move significantly), or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

3. Evaluating the Clustering for Each k:

    Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS): For each value of kk, calculate the WCSS, which measures the total variance within the clusters. This is done by summing the squared distances between each point and its corresponding centroid.
        The goal is to minimize WCSS, which means that the points within each cluster are as close as possible to the centroid, indicating tight clusters.

4. Selecting the Best k:

    Elbow Method: Plot the WCSS against the different values of kk. The plot typically decreases sharply and then levels off. The point where the decrease becomes less pronounced (forms an "elbow") is often considered the optimal kk. This is because adding more clusters beyond this point doesnâ€™t significantly reduce WCSS, indicating diminishing returns.

    Silhouette Score: For each kk, you can also compute the silhouette score, which assesses how well-separated the clusters are. A higher silhouette score indicates that the clusters are well-defined.

5. Repeating for Stability:

    Since K-means can converge to different solutions based on the initial random centroids, it's common to run the algorithm multiple times for each kk with different random initializations. The solution that gives the lowest WCSS or the highest silhouette score across these runs is considered the best clustering for that kk.

Final Outcome:

    After evaluating the clusters across different values of kk, you select the value of kk that provides the best trade-off between the number of clusters and the quality of clustering (often indicated by the elbow in the WCSS plot or the highest silhouette score).

Summary:

    For each kk, run the K-means algorithm multiple times with different initial centroid positions.
    Compare the WCSS (or silhouette scores) for each kk across all runs.
    Choose the kk that provides the best clustering according to your chosen metric (like the elbow point in the WCSS plot).

This approach helps in identifying the optimal number of clusters that best fits your data.
