what is polynomial regression?
    relationship between the independent variable and dependent variables are modeled in the nth degree polynomial

    models are fit using the least square method

    special case of Linear Regression where we fit the polynomial equation on the data with a curvilinear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

assumptions of polynomial regression
    relationship between dependent and independent is linear of curvilinear
    independent vars are independent of each other
    errors are independent, normally ditributed

cost function
    mean squared error
gradient desent wrt coefficients
