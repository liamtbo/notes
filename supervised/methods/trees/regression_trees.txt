each leaf represents numeric value
ex:
    if dosage < 14.5
        4.2% effective
    else:
        if dosage >= 29 ...

root node
    for each feature col
        try different thresholds and choose the threshold with smallest diff between observed and predicted (sum of squared residuals)
    feature with smallest sum of squared residuals becomes root
    keep comparing all feature cols ssr's for each node
stop creating thresholds when sample count is less then a certain amount
