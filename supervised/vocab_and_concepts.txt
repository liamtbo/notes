bias
    an error that occurs due ot overly simplistic assumptions or erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm. If you use bias, it can lead to the model underfitting your data with low predictive accuracy
    linear regression -> high bias
    squigly line -> low bias

cross validation
    allows us to compare different machine learning methods and get a dense of how well they will work in practice
    trains model on first 75%, tests with last 25% of data
    trains model on first 50% and last 25%, tests with middle 25% of data
    trains model on first 25% and last 75%, tests with middle 25% of data
    trains model on first 25%, tests with last 75% of data
    do this with all methods (logistic regression, SVM, K-nearest neighbors)
    chose methods with best cumulative results of tests
    
    ten-fold cross validation most common
    can also be used for tuning hyper params

ensemble methods
    ensemble is a group of elementes viewed as a whole rather than individually.
    ensemble method creates multiple models and combines them to solve a problem

variance
    an error due to complexity in the learning algorithm. In variance, your data gets highly sensitive to high degrees of variation, leading your model to overfit the data. You'll end up carrying noise from your training data for your model to be useful for your test data.
